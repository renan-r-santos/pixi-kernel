Per-directory Pixi environments with multi-language Jupyter kernels.

Pixi Kernel supports Python 3.8+ and Pixi 0.18+ using `pyproject.toml` and `pixi.toml` configurations.

**Disclaimer**: _This project is not affiliated with Pixi, and not an official Pixi plugin._

## Quick Start

This assumes you want a Python kernel. For other languages, check the [Kernel
support](#kernel-support) table and replace `ipykernel` with the desired kernel package.

1. Install Pixi and `pixi-kernel` alongside JupyterLab using `pixi`, `pip` or any other conda or
   pip-based package manager.
2. Restart JupyterLab.
3. Create a new directory and initialize a Pixi project with `pixi init` and `pixi add ipykernel`.
4. Restart the kernel and you are good to go.

See the [Pixi docs](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for more information on how to use Pixi.

## Kernel support

Pixi Kernel supports the following kernels:

| Language | Kernel         | Package name                                             |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bash     | Bash Kernel    | [bash_kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel)  |
| C++      | Xeus Cling     | [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) |
| Python   | IPython Kernel | [ipykernel](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel)        |
| R        | IR Kernel      | [r-irkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)       |

Support for other kernels and languages can be added by opening an issue or a pull request. Check
the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-support-for-new-kernels) for more information on
adding new kernels.

## mybinder.org

You can try Pixi Kernel on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) by clicking the badge at the top of
this README. Check [pixi-kernel-binder](https://github.com/renan-r-santos/pixi-kernel-binder) for
how to set up a Binder repository with Pixi Kernel.

## Limitations

Pixi Kernel does not support using Pixi environments other than the default one. If you have an
idea how to support this, please open an issue or check the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
to open a pull request.
